lscdrom is a simple C++ program to query CDROM drive information on
Linux systems.  Might work on Unix/POSIX but I haven't confirmed.

lscdrom does depend on my other library:

Installation:

1. Run "make".
2. Copy "lscdrom" to wherever you like to put executables.

lscdrom is in the public domain.
